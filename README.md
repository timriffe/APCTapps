Applications of the APCTDL framework

Code and LaTex for a paper together with Jonas Sch√∂ley and Francisco Villavicencio: "Domains of application for the demographic time framework". We expect more coauthors to come.


This project is intended to give a potluck of applications of the framework presented in "A unified 
framework of demograhic time" in assorted domains. This project is just in the planning stage at the
moment, still figuring out which domains to include with data, and which to include with just schematics.

If you're interested, send a note!
